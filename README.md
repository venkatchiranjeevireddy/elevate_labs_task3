# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This is a simple machine learning project that predicts house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, and other amenities. The app is built using Python, trained with Linear Regression, and deployed using Gradio for a clean web interface.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
- Gradio (for web interface)
- Google Colab

## 📌 Features Used for Prediction

- Area (in sq. ft)
- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Stories
- Parking
- Main Road Access
- Guest Room
- Basement
- Hot Water Heating
- Air Conditioning
- Preferred Area
- Furnishing Status (Furnished, Semi-Furnished, Unfurnished)

## 📈 Model Used

- **Linear Regression**: A simple and interpretable regression model from `sklearn.linear_model`.

You can also experiment with:
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Install Gradio if not already installed:
   ```bash
   !pip install gradio
